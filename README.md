This project implements one of the most famous method for a symmetric positive definite matrix for solution of Ax = b problems.
It consists of
a) Implementation of CGM.
b) Convergence analysis for a triadiagnol matrix with plots names as 10iterations,100iterations and 1000 iterations.The method converges after half the iterations.
c)solve for a 2d laplacian with 64 unknown in each dimension and also plots convergence of different choice of r.h.s i.e. nomally distributed random vector and eigen vector for the smallest eigen value .Results are shown laplacian 2d and b_vector plots.
